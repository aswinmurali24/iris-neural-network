# Neural Network for Iris Flower Classification
This repository contains a basic neural network implementation for classifying the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset consists of three different types of flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) and includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# Overview
This project aims to provide a simple implementation of a neural network for the purpose of classifying the Iris dataset. The neural network is built using Python and common machine learning libraries.

# Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width


There are three classes of iris flowers:

Iris Setosa

Iris Versicolor

Iris Virginica

The dataset used in this project is included in the repository as iris.csv.

# Model Architecture
The neural network used in this project is a simple feedforward neural network with the following architecture:

Input layer: 4 neurons (corresponding to the 4 features)
Hidden layer: 2 hidden layer with 8 & 9 neurons (ReLU activation)
Output layer: 3 neurons (Softmax activation, corresponding to the 3 classes)
